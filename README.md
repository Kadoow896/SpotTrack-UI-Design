SpotTrack UI Concept
Project Description:
A 4-page mobile UI design concept for SpotTrack, a music analytics app. The project showcases a complete user journey from authentication to detailed artist exploration.
Screens:
• Sign In (2 Versions): Designed two variations of the login screen to refine the "Connect with Spotify" user experience.
• Dashboard (Top Tracks): Displays a personalized greeting, top artists (Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Ed Sheeran), and weekly listening statistics.
• Artist Profile: A dedicated page showcasing an artist's profile (Billie Eilish) with a list of their top songs.
Tools & Skills:
• Figma: UI components, layout design, and branding.
• Prototyping: Advanced interaction flow linking all 4 screens.
• Visual Identity: Consistent use of Spotify’s signature green and dark mode aesthetics.
